During site maintenance, copy the .htaccess file to /client (the root web directory). This will enable maintenance mode, where user traffic will be redirected to /client/maintenance.php.

You can specify IP addresses to be ignored during site maintenance; this way, you can still access the site like normal with your IP while other users still get redirected.
